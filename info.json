  "description": "A minimalist starter kit with a tier 0 power armor, support for the jetpack, a mini low-output reactor, and the accoutrements you need for robot construction. As simple as 'Install and Play', but includes optional loadout customization for those looking to tailor their experience, such as using solar power instead."
